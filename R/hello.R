# You can learn more about package authoring with RStudio at:
#
#   http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
#
# Some useful keyboard shortcuts for package authoring:
#
#   Object Documentation:      'Cmd + Shift + D'
#   Build and Reload Package:  'Cmd + Shift + B'
#   Check Package:             'Cmd + Shift + E'
#   Test Package:              'Cmd + Shift + T'
#
# Using Git for sharing:
#
#   Open a shell: run 'git init' (if not selected 'Create a Git repository'
#   when create the Rstudio project)
#
#
# Also instead of adding each file manually, we could do something like:
#
#   git add --all
#   OR
#   git add -A
#
# This will also remove any files not present or deleted (Tracked files
# in the current working directory which are now absent). If you only
# want to add files which are tracked and have changed, you would want to do:
#
#   git add -u
#
#
#
#


hello <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
