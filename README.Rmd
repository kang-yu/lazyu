# lazyu

The goal of 'lazyu' is to collect my often-used R functions into a package ..., i.e. to reduce the use of source().

## Installation

You can install the released version of lazyu from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lazyu")
```

You can also install the dev-version of lazyu from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kang-yu/lazyu")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to how to open a directory from r cmd line:

``` r
## open the current work dir
explorer(getwd())
```
